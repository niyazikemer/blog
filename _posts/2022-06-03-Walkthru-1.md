# Walkthru 1

Setup from the scratch:

- Do not use the python that comes with the installation.
- Download mambaforge and work install it and work on the ‘base’ environment

Mambaforge is here:

[https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge)

**Initialization process:**

```bash
# .sh file is a script and to see it
less Mambaforge-Linux-x86_64.sh

# to install
bash Mambaforge-Linux-x86_64.sh

# remove the mamba for a automatical setup 
rm -rf mambaforge/

.bashrc #  automatically runs when you run the terminal so,

# edit the file for removing the conda initialisation, just delete the conda part.

# that will remove the [base] from the command line

# fastsetup arranges everything for a new computer

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fastai/fastsetup/master/setup-conda.sh

./setup-conda.sh #no need for bash at this time because it is already in the script's first line

# doesn't help on the first try, because We need to change permission for execution

chmod u+x setup-conda.sh

# then again:

./setup-conda.sh

# in my case I've got this error

# ./setup-conda.sh: line 22: curl: command not found

# and I install curl: 
sudo apt install curl

# then pytorch from here: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

mamba install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch

# -c pytorch means install things from pytorch channel

# then Jupyter or JupyterLab

mamba install jupyterlab

```

**Tips & Shortcuts for the terminal:**

CTRL-Shift-V is paste in the terminal.

to move things, use `mv`, the first is source and the second is target, if there is no target then it works like a renaming, here is an example:

```bash
mv miniconda miniconda.old
```

to remove things : remove recursively force `r` recursive and `f` forced

```bash
rm -rf 
```

Some list options:

```bash
ls -l # -l is long form list
ls -h #h human readable for example file size as MB or GB but not bytes.

# when you need to use multiple flags then no need to put two times
ls -lf

ls -a # for listing all files (hidden)
```

Aliases:

```bash
# Aliases

# up and down arrows work as shortcuts because of .bash_history

# it is handy to create your scriptsby copying from the history.

# CTRL-r is great for searching in the history in the terminal

# also !ju runs the last one starts with 'ju'

# !! runs the last command

alias jl="jupyter lab" # no spaces and if you want make the aliases persistent then
# to them put in the .bashrc
```
